# What is this?
`The Future is Queer` is an open source mod for non-heteronormative relationships in Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.

`The Future is Queer` uses (the excellent!) [ME3 TweaksModManager and Legendary Explorer](https://github.com/ME3Tweaks) to create and package mods for distribution.
> NOTE: The Mod ID (for ME3Tweaks) is `4730`. I intend to use the `4730`, `4740`, and maybe `4750` Mod IDs.

### What relationships does it cover?
#### LE1 (Mass Effect 1):
* Ashley
* Kaidan

#### LE2 (Mass Effect 2):
* ...TBD

#### LE3 (Mass Effect 3):
* ...TBD

# Doesn't this exist already?
Yes? There are similar mods for ME1 - ME3, and I've seen non-heteronormative mods for specific ME games / characters. 

If similar/identical mods do exist, I have not referenced their code, and don't intend to.

# How can I contribute?
> Real talk: I am doing this for fun and this is not my job, so I make *no promises* as to the timeliness of responses or the likelihood of requests being implemented. Thanks in advance for your understanding.
You can contribute in the following ways:

### Contribute code:
Make a pull request, ideally from an issue.
* You can contribute code to the core game changes ("the mod").
* You can contribute code to improve the distribution / installation of the mod.
    * I won't personally make non-ME3 versions of this mod, but feel free to open a PR with the work done if it's important to you.

### Contribute documentation:
Not sure if this will be necessary, but update notes/documentation in the code or in this README.

This repo includes notes on the changes made to the game's core files in order to achieve non-monogamous relationships. I hope these can be useful for others who want to start modding or make contributions to this mod. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Open an "issue" in this repo. Please take some time to make sure your reported issue(s) aren't already reported -- otherwise it'll take my time. üò¢

### Request a feature
TBD, but probably open an issue.
